# V2 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

Last updated: 2026-10-07  
Repository: `inoriko920-dev/V2-AI-Video-Composer`

## Repository rule
All V2 development happens only in this repository.  
`inoriko920-dev/AI-Automatic-Video-Composer` is a read-only legacy reference and must not be modified.

## Baseline provenance
- Legacy main commit imported: `7d77fc9f724d359c7da6c4796dffce5104740952`
- Exact imported root tree: `7abd82b4a69428a0b1bd25a8d992f402cb0a2ff8`
- V2 migration commit: `835130da71b5a2114100ada903f524dd926a068a`
- Planning/source-of-truth main baseline before Wave A: `192e3d5ac9db73b1d0bd51301df29978cbade232`

## Planning gate
- STEP 00–13 DOCX: present in `docs/v2_planning/`
- Master planning index: present
- Visual QA of planning DOCX: PASS
- STEP 13 CODING GATE: **PASS**
- Approval basis: explicit user instruction to continue after planning completion on 2026-10-07

## Current wave
**Wave A — documentation/source-of-truth commit and baseline CI re-run**

Allowed:
- clarify V2 repository identity and handoff rules;
- record current wave/gates/rollback point;
- run the inherited CI against the unchanged application baseline.

Not allowed in Wave A:
- source-code behavior changes;
- dependency changes;
- render/animation/timeline/UI changes;
- project-schema changes;
- package/release redesign.

## Wave A acceptance criteria
1. V2 source of truth clearly points all future work to V2 only.
2. `src/`, `tests/`, dependency manifests, and runtime behavior remain unchanged from the planning baseline.
3. A V2 pull request runs the inherited Windows CI.
4. Compile, Ruff, strict mypy, cheap pytest, and STEP09 screenshot checks pass.
5. Gate result and exact next action are recorded.

## Rollback point
If Wave A documentation or CI setup causes an unintended issue, reset the V2 work branch to:
`192e3d5ac9db73b1d0bd51301df29978cbade232`

No rollback action may target the legacy repository.

## Next exact action
Create the Wave A documentation-only commit, open a PR to `main`, and evaluate its Windows CI.

- If CI PASS: Wave A gate PASS; merge/close Wave A and proceed next turn to **Wave B — architecture interfaces/capability model with FFmpeg behavior unchanged**.
- If CI FAIL: diagnose and repair only the V2 baseline/CI problem, then re-run before Wave B.
